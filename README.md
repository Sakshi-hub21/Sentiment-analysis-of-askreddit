# Sentiment-analysis-of-askreddit


## Project: Predicting occurence of words

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. Pandas

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

# Code

The code is provided in the Sentiment analysis of askreddit.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included askreddit.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file. Each and every code is explained fro more understanding.

# Data

The askreddit.csv file contains 11259 rows and 8 columns. The columns are title, score, id, url, comms_num, created	, body	and timestamp.


# Steps

1. First we have to read the askreddit.csv file and retrieve all the information we can get like the shape of the file , how many columns are there in the file , Are all the values are present in the file.

2. After observing some of the data we will consider some of the words that are present in the title column that we think can occur maximum times.

3. Same thing we have to do with body column also , find some of the words that occur maximum times.

4. Then we will visualize it using matplotlib library and try to find the the words that we have consider has occured maximum times.
