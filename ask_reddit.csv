Comment,1,hcaf574,,0,1631262740.0,"When I was in my last year of undergraduate I was in a bunch of student clubs and societies. One of them was an atheist/secularist one and a bunch of them would always post about how stupid anyone who believes in God is and how they don't know anything about science.

It was fairly amusing to find one of them in the physics class I was a TA for the next semester. Like bruh shouldn't you be teaching me??",2021-09-10 11:32:20

Comment,1,hcaf0b9,,0,1631262611.0,"My dad died about 5 years ago. He was a good person, and always tried to see the best in other people. He was sick for a long time, and so it wasn‚Äôt unexpected, but still very sad.

I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it: if you have a good relationship with anyone, and they die, it‚Äôs going to suck. Hard. You are going to feel like the colour has left the world, that laughing is disrespectful to their memory, and you‚Äôre going to have the thought of ‚Äúoh, I should ask them about... no... wait.... they‚Äôre dead‚Äù and it‚Äôll hurt all over again. Rinse, wash, repeat. Over and over and over.

While you are going through this, you need to make a conscious effort to make sure that you‚Äôre doing all the things that you need to do to keep alive. Eating actual vegetables, getting exercise, washing yourself, changing your clothes, getting sunshine.

And it will suck, but as trite as it is, it gets better. Someone makes a stupid joke, and you laugh. The hole they left will fill with the memories you had. The colour will eventually come back in, little by little.

Hope you‚Äôre okay there OP.",2021-09-10 11:30:11

   I also have bipolar mood disorder and ADHD  (both pre-existing) which have become more difficult to control because of the traumatic brain injury. 
   
   There is no gross functional impairment due to the TBI, but I guess some people would say I've changed. I know I now struggle to read recreationally, where as I used to enjoy a good book every week or two. I just can't seem to keep the plot threads together now like I used to. 
   
   I'm on 11 different medications to help control my psychiatric illnesses. I've done meds reviews where I wean off everything to see how I cope without meds, and they end badly, so I am more or less certain that whatever the cause, I am ill and need medicine to assist in keeping me a functional and productive adult. Just like any other chronic illness. 
   
   Luckily I have had a very good support structure, a good Psychiatrist and therapist and received the appropriiate treatment.

Comment,1,hcafmyc,,0,1631263187.0,"Kobe Bryant‚Äôs death hit me the hardest because of how tragic it was. Many basketball fans knew that he always went everywhere with his helicopter, but who would ever expect that he would die from one. It was also the day after LeBron passed him on the all-time scoring list and they were both being talked about on ESPN. 

The fact that his daughter died as well was just so heartbreaking and it still feels unreal to this day. Both she and Kobe had so much ahead of them you‚Äôd never think they would in a million years be dead.

Comment,1,hcafmry,,0,1631263183.0,"You my friend, have the easiest issue to solve.  Students are expected to learn and explore. Take it from a long-time academic turned professional (with an interdisciplinary career between several 'most challenging fields').

The question is, ""Are you being productive?""  If you spend a couple months learning additional biochemical kinetics, it's directed study. If you write, you're practicing your trade. Trying to do a little programming to see if it's right for you? Great. Helping out at a non-profit, food-bank, or literally any other place can be a great way to see how different economic sectors work. Nearly anything you do while in college can be framed successfully. Even starting music lessons can be rationalized, and could help jumpstart a healthy work/life balance for your career. (If you took a full load and a half of classes, would the question of not working even be an issue?)

Here's the caveat... Beer pong and TV do not count. You actually have to be productive in one way or another. Just be honest about it.",2021-09-10 11:39:43

Comment,1,hcafll2,,0,1631263153.0,"Yes. 

I always thought I fell in love a lot. I did it over and over again. I actually thought love wasn't ""chemistry"" and ""fireworks"", it was just companionship and strong friendship. All that ""magic"" claptrap was from Hollywood and Disney. I got married, I got divorced. Married again, divorced again. Still hopeful though, because I fell in love easily.

Then I met him. I fiiiinally understood what I had been missing. It all finally made sense. Nothing in my life was ever like this before. Yes, there is companionship - the most satisfying sort of comfortable togetherness. Yes, there is friendship - the best and strongest of my life. But it is so much more. Soooo much more. He is everything to me, and I am to him too. 6 years into the (I now know) only love of my life, we got married. And still, six years in, I smile just to look at him. I smile going to sleep every night with him beside me. I smile waking up every morning because he's there. Magic is right, fireworks are right. It's all there. We can't get enough of each other, and we never get sick of hanging out together. He is my best friend and the best person I have ever known.

Nothing has ever felt like this before. Even if it feels like love, even if it hurts - true love is a million times better, and a million times more worth it.

Comment,1,hcafhao,,0,1631263047.0,"Amstrad CPC 464 way back in the day. After a while I moved onto Commodore Amiga, realised the supplied Basic interpreter wasn't going to do it. I bought a book at some trade show or computer show about Amiga Assembler. I stuck with it and got a really good understanding of assembler in general. Right at the end of the book it told me to go off and learn C. I went off and ordered a couple of books from the back of CU Amiga and went from there.

This was all before I did my A-Level Computing. Back then, the A-Level was primitive and I was surprised when my first homework assignments were handed back with D's and E's (quite low grades). I was annoyed as I knew perfectly well what a stack was, what a queue was and what an accumulator was, what the program counter did, yada yada.

Eventually I figured out that what the teacher wanted was that when a homework question was given, we essentially re-write what was in the book just using a different form of words regardless of whether or not it was applicable in all situations or not. Like I say, the A-Level in Computing was pretty ill thought out and seemed to be based on one single book. Any deviation from the rubric whatsoever would cost you grades even if you were correct and it addressed the question. Stupid really. It was literally take a sentence, rewrite it in different words, there is the answer.

There were a couple of pseudo-code based questions but the question did say ""in any language"". I remember I handed in one answer based entirely on Amiga Assembler. He graded it F as he claimed it was not a real language. I did plead with my parents to let me bring in my Amiga to show him the full working code but it never happened. My five minutes of glory were not to be. I went back to handing in coding assignments in pseudocode and left it at that, it wasn't worth the headache as there would be no glorious victory.

While I understand that learning parrot-fashion can be effective, the whole exercise made me question continuing it. Thankfully the exam itself wasn't quite as stupid and was not based on one single book.",2021-09-10 11:37:27

Comment,1,hcafh3h,,0,1631263041.0,"Twin Peaks is what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äúgenre buster‚Äù: you‚Äôll find horror, comedy / slapstick humor, romance, with a touch of 90s quirkiness that you can‚Äôt find in today‚Äôs shows (times have changed since the first two seasons aired, obviously).

The characters largely contribute to the show. Each and everyone of them has their own personality and ambitions (or lack thereof) and pushes the story forward. Even the small town of Twin Peaks feels alive.

Another major point to consider is that back in the day when it aired for the first time, Twin Peaks was a novelty. The show was the first (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) to offer a main plot that spread across entire seasons, whereas previous TV shows used to wrap up their intrigues by the end of this week‚Äôs episode.

Lastly, there‚Äôs this campy feel when you watch an episode after getting back from work. Once you hear the opening theme, you know you‚Äôre out of our reality and into another where dreams and nightmares coexist and share cherry pie and black-as-a-moonless-night coffee.",2021-09-10 11:37:21

Comment,1,hcafgwu,,0,1631263036.0,"Working in a hotel bar for a luxury hotel.
Had a guy come in around 3 in the morning. Really nothing was happening anymore since it was the middle of the week. He sat down opposite of me and ordered 2 bottles of champagne (for the last 2 guests that were still around) order two cocktails for my colleague and I and afterwards our most expensive Whiskey (Johnnie Walkers King George) which we sell at a solid 75‚Ç¨ per 4cl.... he proceeded to drink half of the bottle being around 40 cl (so 750 bucks only for the whiskey). Later he ended up telling us his wife cheated on him with his best friend, took the kids to leave for her mothers house and he had no other real friends to turn to since all he did was work.

Holy shit I felt awful listening to the guy as you could tell that his life was 100% ruined
He ended up spending around 1200 bucks on drinks and a little to eat and gave a 200‚Ç¨ tip when he was about to leave thanking us for listening...

I really hope he's doing better and atleast got his kids or something. Seemed like a nice guy...

The way it was phrased definitely felt very patronizing, and they were also perpetuating false stereotypes around MSG. They were trying to benefit from Chinese culture while simultaneously putting it down. A more recent example would be a group who tried to redesign mahjong tiles while putting down the original, traditional designs.

Yes, that was my biggest gripe with Resurgence.  We fell in love with the characters in ID4, we got their stories and relationships and we invested in them and that was a HUGE part of how the movie makes you feel.  

I felt the characters were very lazily portrayed in Resurgence and I definitely didn't feel a bond to any of them except - of course - those who had also been in ID4.  LOVED Dr. Oken!",2021-09-10 11:34:10

I could have been more clear on the phone yet my brain mentally shit itself in the moments afterwards. I was in shock.

I'd also buy properties for my friends to live in free of charge and offer them well paying jobs working with my animals if they wished or help them go back to uni to learn a new career that they would enjoy.

Comment,1,hcaf5h5,,0,1631262747.0,"Assuming its really mine;

Get my nan into a top dog care home for alzheimers. Buy her house off her for far more than its worth so we dont lose her house (sentimental to us) and she gets awesome care in a 5 star facility. 
Do up her house as I currently live there, with a disabled room downstairs and bathroom so nan can sleep over our house two or three nights a week so that way she's always got a connection to home.

Meanwhile, buy land nearby and start plans to build my dream home.   
Gather the 10 most trusted people I know and give them an ultimatum, either they all get a million each in a trust fund they can access for anything they want with the promise they NEVER tell anyone where they got the money and must say they won it on a scratch card or an estranged rich aunt died and left them cash. If anyone refuses, no one gets anything. If I find out they told someone its come from me, they're cut off. 

I'd give secret gifts to family and friends, and probably lie after a while and say I won a small amount of money that I have to keep tight if I never want to work again.   

Pay off my and my partners student debts.  

Become a financial backer for my partners firm,he works in film and they have so many good ideas and work so hard but getting funding to do their jobs and not need part time work is bleh. I could make them their own studios with all the kit and support their first 5 films with % back on the return so that I can keep supporting them.

With a bunch of the rest of money? Donate to charities. At least million to cancer research and alzheimers research.  Maybe set up better more affordable care homes here. Our population is just getting older and they need GOOD care. Not basic care. And affordable care that wont fuck people out of their inheritances :(",2021-09-10 11:32:27

Comment,1,hcaf4dy,,0,1631262718.0,"That‚Äôs a fair definition. 

Human cultures exist where people are nomads without a fixed place to live, cultures exist where accommodation is shared by several groups, cultures exist where people live communally.

That says to me that a fixed place ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù to one person or family unit that is their permanent shelter and store of possessions‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs a product of culture with cultural variations and even cultures where it doesn‚Äôt exist. That makes it a social construct, no?",2021-09-10 11:31:58

I‚Äôve made a lot of life choices that haven‚Äôt been great because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been selfish, prioritizing what I want and not what I actually need. I often do this with my mental health.

Comment,1,hcaf3n9,,0,1631262699.0,"Costco gasoline stations are the cheapest gas you'll usually find, so they're always packed. These gas stations are usually large and have several lanes and three pumps per lane. It irks me when people take their sweet time when there are so many people are waiting, but that's to be expected. These are, what Bill Burr calls, ""in-the-way-people"" But what really pisses me off is that one idiot that stops right in the middle of the entrance to the lanes. Let me explain. Costco gasoline stations are usually located adjacent the Costco warehouse in the parking lot. Because there is so much demand, a long line forms snaking though the parking lot just to enter the gasoline station. Because the lanes within the gas station are backed up, the cars entering have to choose which ever lane seems least full as they come in. This means you may end up going to the nearest lane to the entrance or the one farthest. You would think people would be intelligent enough to choose the lane which is least full, but NOOOO. They all bunch up in the lanes nearest the entrance. Yeah, in-the-way-people. So, the entrance is the bottleneck to the whole thing. Here's what pisses me off to no end: There is always an embarrassment to mankind that blocks the very entrance to the gas station itself. The person could've easily been off to the left or right to allow for other cars to get through, or they could have moved inward to one of the lanes farther in, but NOOOO. They choose the obviously crowded lane near the entrance which is so backed up it leaves them blocking entry for everyone else thus stopping all traffic from flowing in until this one lane is able to move forward. In the meantime pumps are freeing up in other lanes but there are no cars to take them. I always feel like getting out of my car, walking over, pulling them out of their car, getting in, and driving it over to a less crowded lane at the farther end. Then hand them their keys with a slap to the face.",2021-09-10 11:31:39

Comment,1,hcaf2fa,,0,1631262667.0,"The brooch my granny gave me while she was still alive. I had an extremely messed up childhood and she was the one singular family member who treated me well and actually wanted to spend time with me. My most fond and vivid memories are from her. I am missing I would say 80% of my memories before the age of 13 due to extensive abuse but I remember all of the time I spent with my granny in perfect detail. I even have a photographic map of her house in my head that is basically my happy place, especially the back yard.

The brooch was a birthday gift. It was two frogs, because she was more obsessed with frogs than I've ever seen anyone obsessed with anything. Her house looked like one of those homes of people with world record collections, but smaller and with frogs. I remember her telling me that she wouldn't be around forever and that she wanted me to have some of her frogs to remember her by. I took that brooch with me everywhere but it fell off my bag on the bus I presume. I only noticed after it had already pulled away. I never saw it again. It's definitely the thing I regret losing most in my life. 

Great I am crying now, I fucking miss you Granny. God dammit. You didn't deserve to die so early.",2021-09-10 11:31:07

She takes me to this office that she rents. She does not own a business of any kind. She just rents this old office that belonged to a dentist back in 1925. Smoked glass doors, transom, etc.  
This office is filled with random Goodwill clothes. I mean thousands and thousands of dresses, pants, suits, etc. Heaped against the walls.  
This cloth, it turns out, is a sort of soundproofing. She rents the office and goes there at night so she can roll around on the floor and scream.

Lol you're totally fine!

It is only legal medicinally here, so you have to pay a doctor whatever their fee is to confirm you have a medical condition that makes you eligible. You then have to pay the state $25 for a card, and an additional $125 for a cultivation license as well. Cards must be renewed every year

You can have 6 plants flowering, 6 plants in veg, and 6 clones at a time, as a single patient (you can apply to become a caregiver for other card holders and grow more plants at a time). There's a limit on how much you can buy from a dispensary in a month, and how many plants you can grow like I mentioned, but *not* on how much you can have in your private residence. My last grow was 2-3lbs of bud :)

Afterward, one of the burglars also sexually assaulted the youngest daughter, and tied both of them to their beds, doused them in gasoline (while they were still alive) as well as the house, and set everything on fire.

Comment,1,hcgsy7g,,0,1631386439.0,"I think being calm and having a lot of patience is the best thing you can do. Just learn when they really need validation. I think sometimes it's a habit and sometimes it's an actual need from the person wanting it. Maybe at some point in a good moment try to talk about that matter, understand the motive of that need. Also Therapy, but that's not something you can make them go to. It's just that you can't do what a therapist could to help them. Most people get annoyed and that's understandable, but showing that you're annoyed just makes the need of validation more intense in my eyes.",2021-09-11 21:53:59

Celebration is something that we do when we are happy or thankful that something happened, mourning is when we are sad or grieving, and remembering could be either, but more likely refers to a sad event or a random fact.

Comment,1,hcgssbz,,0,1631386368.0,"It was only for large apt complexes and they contracted with a company called valet living. The idea is to have a 30gal trash can for each unit. Garbage and recycle are left outside each door and a ""valet"" comes by between 6-10pm and collects it. It's loaded in a employee (not company) pickup truck and driven to the dumpsters on site which are locked to prevent residents from loading and creating a mess. 

Service was sunday-thurs

The service costs about $30/month per unit and it part of the lease

Valet living is a nation wide company actually

They also provide other services like stocking pet waste stations, litter pick up and quarterly building cleaning for areas like stairs/railings.

It's definitely an interesting and very profitable business plan

I definitely have my grievances about he company and the residents often hated the service but I'm not going to bad mouth them in public",2021-09-11 21:52:48

Comment,1,hcgsp4x,,0,1631386330.0,"My wedding was traditional, but on the small side. I think we had somewhere around 50 or 60 guests. It was a very nice ceremony in a lovely little white New England church. The reception was at a local social club that I was a member of. It was also about as traditional as could be. We had an open bar, but with such a small crowd, it wasn‚Äôt too expensive.

We didn‚Äôt do anything crazy that would inflate the cost, and we also paid cash (parents didn‚Äôt have money to help, which was just fine). That is to say, we planned and budgeted it so as to not incur any lasting debt. My wife is very good with money and had it all figured out, including the dress, the rings and the rehearsal dinner.

So, looking back some quarter century, was our small-ish wedding the right choice? Absolutely. We had the traditional ceremony and dignified reception we both wanted, yet we avoided going in too deep and hobbling ourselves with debt. It was just right.",2021-09-11 21:52:10

When the CDC revises their guidelines for schools (which is hugely impactful because schools across the country follow every word) to please a teachers union, you're argument fails.  When the White House mandates vaccines for all employees except for USPS, it fails.  When the White House excludes those crossing the border, it fails.  When science gets set aside because it doesn't match someone's agenda, it fails.  Remember exposed emails from last year that revealed what the experts were telling Fauci back in April and May, but he chose to disregard them?  It fails.",2021-09-11 21:52:06

I guess I just always grew up with the idea that relationships should be between two consenting adults and that the exclusivity of it creates the strength and security of the bond.  Openly, I never voice this opinion beyond saying that it's definitely not my cup of tea.  But it still bothers me even hearing about it.

Comment,1,hcgslfc,,0,1631386286.0,"To me it was something i always had with me since the day i learned how to read. It wasn't in the form of writing then though, more of an unsatiable will to read. I tried writing my first fantasy stories when i was 11. They generally ended with me cringing out of my ass the following day so i always ended up ripping the pages from my notebooks. It was until i turned 16-17 when i sent my stories to professional authours after an atelier. You can guess my excitement when my story got accepted in the top four out of 150 stories. The literature teachers at my highschool were incredible people, it really is all thanks to them that i could rebuilt my courage to get my pen in my hand again. I've been writing in an amateur magazine weekly for a year now, and i am graduating highschool as a four year member of the student literary award comitee. One of my articles got published in a professional internet journal and my stories even got published after being awarded in  literary events.

Long thing short, even if it's a gift, writing is a blade you should always be sharpening through time. None would be able to put up a decent text together by sheer talent. Not only that, but seminars can only help to a certain degree, the only way to write is to read isn't it?",2021-09-11 21:51:26

Comment,1,hcgsleb,,0,1631386286.0,"""Evil"" is a false term created to give direction for morals for humans.

Other animals don't see good or evil, or it's implications.

Dogs for instance don't think humans are evil, even after being beaten, starved, and neglected. Those kinds of characteristics are prevalent in what we would call evil, though.

Morally speaking, mentally handicapped people are incapable of being evil due to genetic defections or medical injuries.

Thusly the terms good and evil cannot truly exist. Evil is your own creation and arguably whatever ""pure evil"" constitutes as is based on your own morality rather than any sort of scale.

However, given how humans typically are, I would surmise that any individual in a position of power who willingly damages or destroys, maimes, or deprives creatures of life constitutes as pure evil.


My number 1 choice of ""pure evil"" would have to go to the numerous people who know that the rapid expansion of human civilization as well as the oil industries.

These people KNOW they are making the world harder to live in and they simply don't care. They care more about their precious ""money"" than the lives of their children or the lives of any living creature. 

These people know how global warming is being directly affected by their industry, but they would protect that industry with the ferocity of a caged and wounded animal. They have continually lobbied so they can maintain the course of history.

__THESE PEOPLE WOULD RATHER SEE THE WORLD BECOME A DESOLATE PLANET THAN LIFT A FINGER TO TRY AND SAVE IT__

And that's my two cents.",2021-09-11 21:51:26

We got married at the courthouse just the 2 of us. And then we had a small wedding in my husband's dad and stepmom's backyard which was covered in fall colors. We had 30 people including us. My brother was the officiant, my husband's sister and her boyfriend sang, my husband's step niece was the flower girl, and my husband's dad and stepmom's dog was our ring dog. For food we had a potluck with BBQ and our cake was 3 Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes. And then the day ended with a bonfire.

I believe in science and listen to medical experts.  I have a Facebook friend who is a genuine PhD bearing expert in a relevant medical field and whose husband works for Pfiezer.  She and the news reports helped reassure me that this was being fast-tracked due to sh\*t loads of cash and resources being thrown at it rather than due to any corners being cut.  If anything it got MORE research done on it because of all the countries pouring money into it.

I got the vaccine as soon as I possibly could, and I will immunise my special needs son as soon as he either becomes old enough to qualify under the current UK vaccine rules or they lower the age range to include his age group.  I want him vaccinated not just for his own safety, but for the safety of the carers and school staff who work with him, his fellow pupils (some of whom are medically vulnerable), and the other vulnerable folk that the carers come into contact with.

Covid-19 can kill.  I don't want anyone in our family to be responsible for passing on something that causes someone to die.

Comment,1,hcgsgmw,,0,1631386229.0,"Might be a little late, and I hope the person that I had this experience with doesn‚Äôt have Reddit. But‚Ä¶

I was, probably, 15 at the time. I was at my Dad‚Äôs house for a summer. My stepmom had these friends who were gay, let‚Äôs call them ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù. Well, A was like this super laid back guy. Was into all kinds of music, which is how we became super good friends. We‚Äôd talk Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper, NIN, all types of music. B was this dry, sarcastic, ‚Äúbitchy‚Äù type of gay man(I really don‚Äôt want to offend anyone) B‚Äôs nickname was ‚Äúqueenie‚Äù. So anyway, A and B are over, we‚Äôre all in the pool at my Dad‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs getting close to dinner. We were all going to eat, then just hang out at this little outdoor fest that was going on.

My Dad is like, ‚ÄúHey, go change, come down to eat, and we‚Äôll go.‚Äù Sweet. I‚Äôm headed upstairs, and B is following me up. He had to change, too‚Ä¶and the other bathrooms were in use. I walk into my room, and B is like, ‚ÄúJust give me your shorts and you can change.‚Äù I kind of froze. Like, he was almost blocking the doorway, hand out, like he expect me to drop trow and give him my trunks. I‚Äôm doing some quick thinking‚Ä¶all the while, B is just standing there, tapping his toes, hand out, looking at me with this serious face. I sunk back a bit. All I could think of was, ‚ÄúIf B touches me/makes a move, I will punch this dude dead in his face!‚Äù

I blinked, and realized, the bathroom is right behind him, and the door is open. Found my out! I let B know, ‚ÄúYo, I‚Äôll step into the bathroom, change in there, and leave my trunks on the floor.‚Äù I grabbed my clothes, and bee lined it past him.

For the rest of the night, B had this pissed off vibe whenever I would speak. Like, he was trying to get something, didn‚Äôt get it, and now‚Ä¶had to let me know he ‚Äúhated‚Äù me.

I‚Äôm now in my late 30‚Äôs, and‚Ä¶anytime my stepmom mentions that A and B are coming over, I automatically have plans for that day so, I can‚Äôt make it.",2021-09-11 21:50:29

She was buying clothes, stuff from the garden center, office supplies, one or two pieces of that overpriced patio furniture that you always ask: ""why would you buy this from a Long's?"" Probably some food and paper products. Honestly, it seemed like a few things from every aisle.

Also, Long's is weird. It's got way more everyday type items than your average CVS or Duane Reade type drug store. But it's also much smaller than a Walmart or Target. So you generally wouldn't go there for back to school clothes shopping (but other school supplies, yes).",2021-09-11 21:50:10

Comment,1,hcgsem5,,0,1631386204.0,"I have cystic acne. My very first recommendation would be to consult your doctor, they could provide antibiotics, cremes and in severe cases accutane. When it comes to The Ordinary I highly recommend Niacinamide, which works wonders to even out the skin, reduce scarring and redness. It also gets rid of impurities. In the beginning you might experience a ‚Äùpurge‚Äù, it looks worse before it looks better. It has been like a god-sent for me. I use it both day- and night time. I use The Ordinary‚Äôs Rose seed oil at night as it calms the skin and gives it moisture. Both of these are recommended for acne-prone skin on their website. There are more products you could try, check out their site.

Comment,1,hclo5o3,,0,1631475746.0,"I'm not sure why people fuss about the father's opinion. The baby isn't born yet, meaning it isn't exactly living. It has yet to form any bond or connection to the father, besides it being made out of his sperm. Who is doing the carrying of the child? Who is going through morning sickness? Who is getting the swollen feet? Who is going into labor? The mom. What does the dad do while the baby is being created? Best case, helping the mother while physically feeling the same. It reminds me of how some doctors don't let women get a hysterectomy without husband's permission or already having kids, while men can get the snip with near to no question. And I do feel bad for the men who want an abortion but the mother doesn't. I see a lot of people saying he just should have wore a condom, but those aren't 100% reliable. If the mother wants the baby, she wants the baby and she can be responsible for it. It's like buying a dog without telling anyone and throwing the responsibility on your parents/roommate/partner/whatever. Though totally different case if the mother lives in a place where abortion is illegal.",2021-09-12 22:42:26

Comment,1,hclo0id,,0,1631475689.0,"I was talking to some guy at one of my SO‚Äôs friends Christmas parties I get dragged to every year. Anyway, somehow the topic of gaming PCs and computer hardware comes up and he‚Äôs telling me how excited he is because he just bought the new ryzen 7 to replace his old i5 and how he can‚Äôt wait to get more than 60 FPS on cs:go. I immediately had my doubts about this whole idea of his so I asked him what motherboard he had bought, and he said he didn‚Äôt need a new motherboard, he was just gonna use the same one that was already in the pc as it still worked fine. Even though I tried to explain to him that he would need a new motherboard for the amd processor, he kept insisting his motherboards processor slot would work with any processor and didn‚Äôt want to listen to me as I was trying to get him to ‚Äúwaste money‚Äù. At this point, I didn‚Äôt even bother to mention his monitors refresh rate was probably 60 hz, and that buying a 120 or 144 hz was a must for an increased frame rate. I just went and watched football in the den with all the other dudes and called it a night on socializing. 

Note: for clarification, he had 2 big errors in his logic. First, If his frame rate would not exceed 60 flat that signifies a 60hz refresh rate, which means max of 60 frames per second. In order to increase frames, he would need a monitor with higher refresh rate, which he most likely did not know. Second, because he was switching to an amd processor from an intel processor, his motherboard was and intel motherboard, and he would have to go buy an amd motherboard for his new processor for it to work.",2021-09-12 22:41:29

What we didn't expect was a VERY evenly and well tannned, mid-60's gentleman in nothing but hiking boots and a sun hat.  At the trailhead.  

I don't know why that was so shocking.  We had about 1.5 miles from the trailhead to the springs so I guess it was just so unexpected.

I had no idea why he was so mad. I went up to Buffalo to visit my dads side of the family like 5 years ago. My grandad was cool af but I didn‚Äôt really anything to say to my father. I also have like 5 younger brothers and one older brother that I have never met. I think my dad not being a part of my life was probably for the best.

Comment,1,hclnna9,,0,1631475546.0,">But when it comes to rationing, they absolutely should be bottom billing. Not because of the punishment factor, but because the survival of an anti-vaxxer over the survival of somebody who has a surgery postponed is a travesty.

Interesting that you label them anti-vaxxer. If someone has all their other vaccines but has hesitation specifically about the newly released mRNA vaccines, does that necessarily make them an anti-vaxxer? 

I love the Covid vaccines but I'm not sure we should label people anti-vaxx unless they are truly against vaccines in general. 

I declined a tetanus booster even though the CDC advises them because I was aware that the UK's NHS and the WHO says they're unnecessary. I would hope that I wouldn't be labeled ""anti-vax"" by doctors (or future doctors like yourself) for declining it. 

Thankfully, harmful vaccines are rare, but there have been instances: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html)

Would you have labeled anyone who raised concerns about particular vaccines when they were still new as ""anti-vax,"" even in the rare instances where their concerns turned out to be well-founded?",2021-09-12 22:39:06

I sold everything I could and had an ok job (this is 2010-11 and job ended in 2012 from budget cuts). Took a few grand cash and bought 4 acres junk land in the middle of nowhere (I was a tribal forester so was used to being in the middle of nowhere). My lot was an old dot rubble dump. I also got a 40 year old junk camper for $200 and just rode a bike or walked everywhere (carpooled to work). Lived there in upstate ny 7 miles from Quebec border and just ignored credit and banks and telling debt collectors to kiss my ass.

Turned that lot into a farm while living in a series of shacks and sheds then saved up over a few years and got a bigger place and built a bigger cabin with barns and livestock and an outhouse and a hand pump well. When the job ended I just became a full time homestead farmer making lots of small incomes selling surpluses.

The police basically told them that the dad was ran over by a car and died on the spot. As expected the family burst into tears, grabbed their things and drove to the morgue to identify the body. When they got there, they slowly walked to the room where the body was, hugging each other in tears, the people removed the cover. Suddenly they stopped crying and realized that the body wasn‚Äôt the dad. The morgue people baffled told them they found the wallet with the ID on his pocket.

Turns out, the dad went out of town that day and got mugged while waiting for his ride.The cellphone, his wallet and everything he had got taken away. The thief who ran away later got crushed by a car and died. Talking about fucking karma right there.

Comment,1,hczn6yd,,0,1631735177.0,"I have been smoking for years and have tried just about every type and form of cannabis. It's important to know this question can't really be answered. Your body is unique and will react differently. In general we discuss marijuana highs on a spectrum from sedative to stimulative. The entourage effect from the unique terpene and cannabinoid profile of the varietal consumed will dictate where in the spectrum the high lands. Sedative highs feel like being sleepy, but not tired. Its most extreme it's called couch-lock because you are sunk into the couch and don't want to/ feel like you can't get up. These varietals treat pain and anxiety. On the other end of the spectrum you'll feel stimulated, creative, energetic, focused, even anxious. Those who have or are prone to anxiety will experience anxiety while consuming these varietals. The cross breeding of genetics has created plants with effects that dot the entire spectrum between these two points. As your tolerance scales up the effects become less pronounced. If you consume more than you're body can process (over dose) you will find a spot to curl and nap. Cannabis nor any of it's naturally occurring derivatives can kill you. If you're interested I recommend going to a legal store front buying marijuana flower and try one or two hits for a whole day. Each time you try it use just a little more than the last time, until you find your sweet spot.",2021-09-15 22:46:17

Comment,1,hczmz73,,0,1631735095.0,"Potentially yes. It merely states that *any* alcohol consumption affects the brain negatively. So fruit would be no exception. However, there is a large difference between drinking wine, and eating say, a banana. Even Non alcoholic beer still contains trace amounts of alcohol in it, but it might even contain more than a ripe banana. 

Yes, there are sources that suggest that moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial, However, as I already stated, there are many other ways to gain these benefits, and probably in greater forms too. For instance, light cardio, a few times a week would be more beneficial than sitting back and cracking open a brewski... obviously. 

And if you were thinking of ""micro dosing"" alcohol, then you have already stated that fruits and other foods/drinks already have trace amounts of alcohol in them, so it would still be better to just not do it.",2021-09-15 22:44:55

Pitbull biting power is actually surprisingly average. Nearly equal to a Labrador. Huskies, dobermans, bulldogs, and German Shepards for example all have more PSI in their bites than pitbulls.

Pitbulls are also often mistaken for other breeds that do have more powerful bites such as a Cane Corso or Rottweilers, etc. 

There are a lot of myths sorrounding them and they're often made out to be villains because of ignorance. They're also some of the most tolerant dogs, right behind labs in that category as well.

""All I avoided was was the last chance to watch them live."" I'm  sorry for your losses and I'm sorry you are still carrying around that sadness and guilt.  

But please let go of the guilt and hold the good memories you have of your grandparents even closer.  And pass on what you have learned about being there for our loved ones at the end of their life to your friends and other family members.  

We live and we make mistakes and we learn from those mistakes and we grow and become  better people.  Not all of our mistakes are our own, but result from  attitudes we are taught by our culture.  And fear of death and the process of dying is taught to us.

Comment,1,hczmwh8,,0,1631735068.0,"This happened 4 days ago. It was Saturday night and I had plans to go out to the college football game. Before heading out I meet my friends at their place for the pregame (Note: I haven‚Äôt drank for over 6 months but whenever I do drink it takes a lot to get drunk, M22.). I get to his house and probably over the course of an hour me and a friend take 6 shots each. I get to the game buzzing hard and over the course of the game I buy three beers for myself. The game ends, we win and had to go and celebrate.

After leaving the game, we walked to a bar near by where a buddy of mine works. So of course I got free drinks from him and bought drinks through out the time I was there. At some  point at the bar I completely black out, I don‚Äôt remember what happened, who I saw, when we left, I was a complete shit show and pushed my boundaries way past the limits. I think we were at the bar for like two hours before going back to my buddies house.

Apparently we got back to his house it was roughly 1:30 AM and I don‚Äôt have much memory of this but according to my friend, we were just chilling in his back yard winding down, when suddenly I just tell him I‚Äôm walking home. So my not really drunk friends just lets me walk home complete obliterated.

I‚Äôm not sure how I got home where I walked but I have the faintest memory (or dream, I can‚Äôt differentiate if it happened or not) of playing volleyball with random people. I think based on drunk texts I got home at around 4:50 AM, so I have 3ish hours I have no clue what happened.

I woke up the next day and I couldn‚Äôt find my keys or my wallet(RIP), but I had some random person ID on the ground but I was alone in my room. So I had a shit ton of questions like: Did I come home with someone?, where are my keys and wallet, how did I get home and inside with out my keys?, etc. So I was in shambles that morning. So I call my friend to go to the bar to see if my shit was returned. Turns out my keys were but no wallet :/. I later check my phone to see if there was any evidence of where I went and how I got home and I didn‚Äôt find any thing on my phone. I‚Äôm still working to get the other person‚Äôs ID back (in contact just gotta meet them), my wallets gone forever which is so sad cause I have had the thing for over 15 years so it‚Äôs sad to part ways, and lastly I‚Äôm now forever scarred by drinking from how scared I was the next morning of not being able to account for myself for over 4 hours.

TLTR: Drank too much, blacked the fuck out, can‚Äôt account for how I got home or where I was for 3ish hours, scariest night of my life cause IDK what I did or what I said to people",2021-09-15 22:44:28

Comment,1,hczmuw6,,0,1631735050.0,"Yes. For the reason that female contraceptive pills are such a mine field. Like i dont think iv ever met a woman who has found the 'perfect pill' its always got some bad side effects. Its the least i could do really.

The female pill just disrupts a cycle of hormones in one of a number of ways. This almost always sends said hormones into an imbalance that the body rarely seems to like. A male pill would likely inhibit one of the componant parts of seman which is an ongoing process and have less to no side effects.

Plus my son was born on the pill sooo.... be careful kids!",2021-09-15 22:44:10

Comment,1,hczmtxh,,0,1631735040.0,"I was in a HMMWV in the Texas back country when the driver rolled it. Not really his fault, muddy road, bad driving conditions and up-armored humvees had a lot of weight high on the truck. 

One moment everything‚Äôs fine and the next you can feel the vehicle start to go sideways. There‚Äôs this lurch in your stomach, and then you‚Äôre off the road, and the tires grab, but only the right side. There‚Äôs this perfect clarity, and I remember just acknowledging that whatever was going to happen was out of my control. According to the driver, I was whooping with joy. Then we were upside down at a 45 degree angle with the vehicle caught against a tree. Then the fear hit. Was everybody okay? Was the unit going to punish us? How was I going to get out? Just sheer, unmitigated panic for about two minutes until everyone confirms that they‚Äôre alright, nobody‚Äôs hurt. 

Then you start to figure out what had happened, how to move forward. Shut off the engine, one by one get out the gunner‚Äôs position (only door that you could open at that angle). Worst part was unbuckling the seatbelt and hitting the ceiling. Humvees are full of sharp, hard metal. BFT (a computer in the front passenger seat) sliced open my leg, but then I could sort of slowly crawl back through and out. 

In the end, with the help of another hmmwv we were able to flip it upright, and the thing was right as rain. But for those two minutes right after, it was the most scared I‚Äôve ever been. Everyone in that truck was a friend. Some of the best people I‚Äôve ever known. Accepting that you might die is hard. Realizing that your friends might be hurt is panic-inducing.",2021-09-15 22:44:00

The creater of wonder woman is  William Moulton Marston, born 1893, pen name Charles Moulton.

A qoute:  


''Through his psychological research, Marston had come to the conclusion that women were naturally superior to men, both morally and in terms of skill. Further, he believed that women‚Äôs tendency toward loving submission was far preferable to masculine authority, which he viewed as toxic and violent.  
Additionally, the goal of the much-vaunted bondage imagery that pervaded Marston‚Äôs stories was two-fold: first, to serve as a metaphor for the oppression women suffer in patriarchal society, and second, to add an erotic element so that young readers found themselves associating submission with love, through what Marston called ‚Äúsex love training.‚Äù''",2021-09-15 22:43:50

For example. I have a file folder system that I use. I have a few projects I am working on (programming a budgeting app, a program to keep track of chores., and many more(most of which are still in simple designing stages)). so I have a folder labeled accordingly to enable me to quickly grab whatever I need. which is key cause I often get a lot of random ideas for things, so being able to get what I need quickly helps me write it down (draw it) before I forget it.

other things that help me are naming conventions, labeling things, good desk/office space, and color coding things.

&#x200B;

also tracking what you do is helpful especially your time, For instance I use a couple of apps, one tracks what apps i am using on my phone, and another app called simple time tracker, that I use to track what I did with my time (sleeping, eating, playing games, social media, projects etc.)

one thing I personally believe is that ""you cannot change your life until you know what your doing with you life"" and I do not mean you know where you want to be in life, I mean where you are right now. so tracking my time helps me to see things like, ""I spent 20 hours playing video games this week"" or other trends. Simple Time Tracker keeps a good record and lets you see how much time you spent on whatever each week/month/day. so you can kinda see trends in your life.

When the Orthodox New Year came around, she texted me, asking me to go to her room, but what my dumb ass replied was: ""Nah, thanks. I'm good. I've just been out with some friends and I need to rest now.""

But this girl was actually persistent and we ended up texting back and forth for about an hour.

In the end, she sent me a message with a pissy undertone: ""Fine, go to sleep and rest, good night.""

My dad got preoccupied helping my older sister do something, and woops! I had crawled off the side of the dam.

He heard me scream my way down, and jumped in after me. I was extremely lucky. I had suffered almost no injuries. The doctors were amazed!

Then again, I've been to the dam since then a few times, and it's more like a bridge to be honest. I think it's supposed to be some sort of backup emergency flood gate thing in case the water breaches the big power generating dam upriver.

Comment,1,hczmjs4,,0,1631734929.0,"It‚Äôs right now. I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease 15 years ago and have spent those 15 years seeing a nephrologist every 3 months, eating a ridiculously strict diet and follow all medical recommendations. I got evicted from my house in south Texas (thanks child killer Abbott) and had to move in with my brother 250 miles away. For a month now I‚Äôve been trying to get a new nephrologist. I could tell my kidneys weren‚Äôt doing well so went to an ER in a teeny, tiny west Texas hospital. They did some tests and said yep, you‚Äôre at end stage renal disease (ESRD) which means I need to be starting dialysis ASAP.  However, all the Nephrologist‚Äôs have cut back their clinic hours in order to be at the hospital to take care of - anti vaxers who decided risking COVID was the way to go. Now those jack asses have filled the hospitals and every doctor in town is hard at work for long hours trying to save the chronically stupid from themselves. I can‚Äôt see a nephrologist for another month. I‚Äôm furious and terrified. Will I live another month without medical assistance. I guess we‚Äôll see.

Comment,1,hddiaoz,,0,1631997002.0,"I'm one of the hospital pharmacy staff who goes into a high sterility, negative pressure room to make IV bags of all kinds. We take care of every patient in the end, but when we have to drop everything to scrub up and put on full garb to shoot STAT remdesevir, RegenCov (monoclonal antibodies), Nimbex to keep your lungs paralyzed so you don't fight the pump, etc., I can't help but feel some animosity towards these people who work against us by going unvaccinated/unmasked, and then they rely on our care. They are holding up everything else for patients who don't have Covid, and they're STILL, even after last year, making it unnecessarily difficult (to say the least) for anyone working in a hospital.

What I like least about it is seeing how little people really give a shit. And I see some of them at death's door when I go up to ICU on deliveries.",2021-09-18 23:30:02

Comment,1,hddiabf,,0,1631996998.0,"It depends on how many versions survive, and how they compare to each other.  We have copies of works written by Flavius Josephus, who lived between about 40 CE and 100 CE, though I could be off on that by a few years.  That was the general era though, so he was writing around the time Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans in 70CE, only 40 years after the alleged death of Jesus.

Some versions of his writings mention Jesus, or have references to his apostles, but other versions do not, leading some scholars to believe that the versions mentioning him were altered by later Christian writers during the process of recording them and preserving them over the centuries.",2021-09-18 23:29:58

And finally stop letting politics into classrooms.  Kids should be taught the full political spectrum from capitalism to communism and everything in-between.

Comment,1,hddi7s2,,0,1631996970.0,"This one time, when I was 15 or something, I got contact lenses. It was the second day, and I was still only wearing them for an hour or two at a time, like the optimetrist recommended. He walked me through it, showed me how to insert and remove them, clean them, gave me great advice, he was great. I was just a noob. One of them wouldnt come out, so I ended up fumbling around on my eyeball to try and get the thing. But of course, it slipped up under my upper eyelid. I spent about half an hour poking around before I finally managed to rub the damn thing down, my eyebal looked like a tomato. It was fine in the morning, and I took a day to let the irritation go down. But oh my god it felt good to finally pull the damn thing out, it hurt a lot, eyes are sensitive. 

Still continued to wear them daily for about 7 years.",2021-09-18 23:29:30

Comment,1,hddi773,,0,1631996963.0,"Yes but the energy and matter disperses after we die. It‚Äôs no longer together, like you said, and so it‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúus‚Äù. It‚Äôs only a part of us while we‚Äôre alive and together. The togetherness is what makes it unique and what gives us consciousness. So yes, we are always a part of the universe and that gives me great comfort, but those pieces of us that float around after we die aren‚Äôt stamped with our knowledge or personality or our soul.

The other stuff - the DMT experiences, the children recalling past lives (which is actually very infrequent and almost always unconfirmed), and the thoughts of repeating history sound nice and almost poetic in a way, but there‚Äôs just no good evidence that any of it is true. I‚Äôve read up quite a bit on DMT and listened to some podcasts about it and it‚Äôs all super interesting, but it all comes back to an experience that someone had while taking drugs. And some experiences that people have directly contradict other experiences that other people on DMT have also had, which right there tells me that it‚Äôs unlikely that there‚Äôs some deeper truth there. 

In any case, all of these anecdotal stories that people have for an afterlife or rebirth or the process of dying all occur within a functioning brain. Whether it be from DMT, or a near death experience, it‚Äôs all happening in someone‚Äôs brain. But we‚Äôre talking about what happens when that brain stops functioning. And of course, we don‚Äôt have any stories from people who have had their brain stop for periods of time, so its just difficult for me to conclude that there is any good reason to think there‚Äôs something beyond that based of the knowledge we currently have.

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would *love* to be wrong on this. I love thinking about the kinds of possibilities there could be for an afterlife or rebut thing process. I too have considered the idea of the same personalities just recycling over and over. It‚Äôs a cool concept. I don‚Äôt think it could possibly be that simple (our population growing exponentially would create a need for ‚Äúnew‚Äù personalities over time), but either way I just don‚Äôt see a reason to think that it is or could be true. You acknowledge that and say that it‚Äôs just a feeling that you have, and I know that‚Äôs a super common response with super natural beliefs and a response that I used to give too. But when I truly asked myself why I had those feelings, it usually came down to what I *wanted* to be true as opposed to actual truth. I think that (and religious belief/indoctrination) are probably the main source of those feelings for many. There is mystery in our brains, our lives, our deaths. But we are also one species on one tiny planet in one small solar system within a larger galaxy which is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in our universe. Are we the only special ones that get an afterlife? Does every living being have an afterlife? Do ants, for example, have an afterlife? Why or why not? How about the alien beings on a moon hundreds of billions of light years away? Our lives are amazing and precious, but almost impossibly small. I think there is an obvious desire to exist forever in all of us, I just don‚Äôt think the evidence is there to back it up. 

Thank you for the response and the conversation, I very much appreciate it!",2021-09-18 23:29:23

Anyway, we had PE last outside this day in particular and I was helping return the equipment at the end of the class, and this group of lads on the balcony of the school watched me climb the stairs with my hands full (was carrying large traffic cones) and one of them ran up behind me and pinched me in between the legs, I screams and jumped in the air and he and his friends laughed, and unfortunately I was too shell shocked to tell the teacher who just missed witnessing it happen.",2021-09-18 23:29:15

Comment,1,hddi1a2,,0,1631996899.0,"Was naturally like that, since no one is born believing in a religion. Never found a religion I could believe in. Tried Christianity, didn't really buy it, saw the massive hypocrisy there, and then looked farther back, and realized that there were thousands of deities worshipped before christ, and It made no sense that this one was right, while all the otheres were wrong.

Tried Odinism and couldn't believe that either.Tried looking into Judaism, couldn't buy that euther. Tried hellenism, same thing there. 

I thought I had to believe in a religion because everyone else I knew did, and I came to point where I was just done trying. Hypocrites everywhere in religious circles. Everywhere. Judging others because they didn't believe the same thing they did. Missionaries and preachers telling everyone they'd be punished for not believing, no matter how good they were to others.

The above problems really weren't that present in Hellenism and Odinism, which by themselves had their own problems, often being tied to white suptemacy.

I just finally was done with it, and there was no benefit to me either way, as I was already a good person, and if I was going to be punished for not believing, I didn't want to praise that deity anyway.

Never bought it, but tried to.",2021-09-18 23:28:19
Comment,1,hddi19g,,0,1631996899.0,"When I was about 4 years old, before I really learned how to swim, I was on a pool float. I was being babysat by some of our extended family. The adults went somewhere else. I remember the last adult telling me to just stay on the float and sincerely agreeing to do so. Then I got uncomfortable and shifted just a little and the float dumped me. The water was about a foot over my head, and this pool didn't have a shallow end, stairs, or a ladder.

I looked around under water for a second then decided to try jumping to grab onto the float. I tried to reach the float a few times, but each jump was a little less successful. I wasn't even able to break the surface the last two times. 

I remember feeling panic when my lungs started burning, but it was brief. I was holding my breath, looking up at the sky and sun through the water. Suddenly, I just felt very calm and peaceful. Like everything would be OK. When I couldn't hold my breath any longer, I opened my mouth. I saw the bubbles rise past my face as I felt the water rush in. Then nothing. In my next moment of awareness, I was waking up, completely dry, on their couch. No one ever talked about it or said anything. Only the crystal clear realism is why I'm certain it wasn't just a dream.

Whenever anyone has asked me those ""would you rather"" or ""how would you want to go"" questions, drowning is how I answer. It's fast. The pain and panic only last as long as you can hold your breath, if even that long. But it's that sense of total calm and peace that I'd want to have in my last moments. The process of dying itself concerns me far more than what comes after.",2021-09-18 23:28:19

I've tried to just dismiss it as nonsense or mere wishful thinking, but it just keeps on returning to my mind as a genuine possibility. I'm convinced that if you do lose all sense of time that the moment experienced after this loss would basically be infinite in nature and length. So while you actually die soon after losing your perception of time, you would be completely unaware of it. As far as your perception goes, you'd be forever conscious and present in such a timeless moment. It makes sense to me anyway, but I admit that I am quite possibly totally wrong.

Comment,1,hddhymc,,0,1631996869.0,"When I was 15, I got into an argument with a friend.  At the time, there was a lot of drama going on at home, and this friend wanted to know the details.  After he kept badgering me, I told him just so he'd shut up, and I made him swear not to tell anyone.  However, this escalated into an argument where he kept insulting my mother.  After he ignored my warning to stop, I lightly kicked him.  I barely touched him, but like a bratty little sibling who got smacked for annoying his brother, he whined to another friend and exaggerated what really happened.  So, I got kicked out, but he thought I hadn't suffered enough.  So, he deliberately told my other friends the dark family secret I told him in confidence from earlier while I was locked outside begging him to stop.",2021-09-18 23:27:49

Comment,1,hddhycf,,0,1631996866.0,"Micha≈Ç Drzyma≈Ça.

There was a period in history when Poland was occupied by Russia, Austria and Prussia (Germany). Prussian authorities wanted to overtake the Polish land, so they supported Germans settling on Polish areas but denied the Poles the right to buy the land or build a house. 

So, mister Drzyma≈Ça bought a circus wagon and made it his home. At that time, Prussian law assumed that a dwelling was a house if it was stationary for more than 24 hours, so he would just move the wagon every day, thus avoiding any penalties. Bonus points of making fun of absurd law and annoying the occupants.",2021-09-18 23:27:46

Comment,1,hddhxpu,,0,1631996859.0,"A wooden railroad beam takes first place. A toothpick takes second place.

The beam had a bit of wood jutting up I didn't see and I accidentally kicked it with my bare toe while walking down it. This ended with me being held down while someone pulled my bloody, broken toenail off with a pair of pliers. I was maybe 9 or so? I was left with a fear of open toed shoes and sandals well into me twenties as a result.

The toothpick happened when I was 17. Dad dropped one on the floor. The end of it caught on my sock. The other end caught in the carpet. It speared straight up and drove itself halfway into my heel. About a third of it broke off inside and stayed there for a month before I could pop it out like an infected zit.",2021-09-18 23:27:39

Comment,1,hdfyf9i,,0,1632042519.0,"Didn't work at Disney, but at another worldwide theme park doing pretty much the exact same thing (parts of the job were very much to make us more like Disney). 
Highlights I remember was when I was with one of our characters (who obviously can't talk) and I was trying to get a kid to hug the character and they got confused and gave me a hug (very very heartwarming) and also at Christmas working as an elf in the Santa's grotto when father Christmas would ask the kids what they wanted for Christmas and then the parents faces when the kid said something they weren't expecting. 
Strangest things though are when the parents try to get you to admit there's someone inside the costume when you're within earshot of the kids and get quite persistent about it (obviously you can never admit that the characters aren't real), or when it goes the other way and people completely forget that there's someone in the costume and basically let their kids assault the character (especially as alot of the costumes aren't the easiest to move in and are quite top heavy), to the extent that one person I was working with got sexually assaulted in costume while I was working with her.",2021-09-19 12:08:39

Comment,1,hdfycdg,,0,1632042456.0,"Camping in the Sequoia National Park for a week with a group of high-school buds, at the Lodgepole campground. A bit of underage drinking and up late talking shit, we got hungry and starting grilling some Carne asada, somewhere near 2 am in the morning. 

One of our friends walked into the the darkness to grab something from his car only to sprint back and jump over the camp fire we had going and started shouting at us. 

In disbelief, he tells us about nearly walking into a black bear just outside of view. Out of the 6 of us sitting around, I was the only one left sitting across from the table when opposite of me the bear in question appears between there and the fire pit.

The rest of the guys immediately freaked out and sprinted back into their tents, making a commotion that seemed to distract the bear. Me, with a little knowledge of the subject choose not to run away and give this animal cause to chase.

Well, not sure if this was the best course of action in hindsight. With all the food sprawled across the table and only me in the way, this 6 ft boy stands up a let's out the huge type of roar that you hear in the movies. He belts out a good one then slams his paws on the table, all whilst I'm still sitting across from it, sitting very still. It was at that point I said, alright it's time to go, I slowly walk away and retreat into my tent for minute.

While peeking through the door flap I observed this huge hungry bear grab only a pack of flour tortillas and run off with it in its mouth and disappear within seconds. 

We quickly wrapped things up and shoved all our food away in the storage locker at the sight and spent the next couple hours making a bunch of noise and scaring off the reflective eyes that kept popping up on the fringe of the campfire glow. That was one sleepless night. Good times besides that.",2021-09-19 12:07:36

Comment,1,hdfyc4a,,0,1632042450.0,"I really enjoy cooking, and there‚Äôs one particular dish that I cook because it‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs favourite, and I love it too. After a busy day at work, I‚Äôll head out to the vegetable patch in my garden and pick the best looking onion that I can possibly find, along with the plumpest tastiest bulb of garlic. I‚Äôll then dice them finely and start the magic in a saut√© pan, on a medium heat, with some fresh, locally-produced artisanal butter and maybe a little olive oil, pressed from specially selected olives grown by a dear friend near the beautiful Italian mountain village of Picinisco. Once the onion and garlic begins to soften I‚Äôll add one carefully prepared organic chicken breast to the pan, delicately cut into cubes. Once the chicken is nicely sealed I add a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc to the party to deglaze. As the sauce reduces I pour a glass for my wife and take it to her to enjoy while she cuddles with our cat in front of the fire, the stress of her day beginning to melt away. 
Once reduced, it‚Äôs time to add half a pint of chicken stock, and reduce again. The garlic bread enters the oven as I pour a cup of double cream in, adding the perfect amount of salt, pepper and more chopped garlic for the final round of careful reduction. The sauce is complete, and married to fresh homemade tagliatelle it tastes absolutely exquisite, enjoyed further with the rest of the wine. 

Now the best smell in the world‚Ä¶I have developed a bit of an intolerance to lactose over the past few years, and I love garlic but it seems to produce a wicked reaction in my gut. The dish tastes wonderful, but my proudest creation, and the best smell in the world, is the absolute wallpaper-curler of a fart that inevitable comes shortly after. Everyone loves their own brand.

TL:DR - a recipe for success.",2021-09-19 12:07:30

Out of everything I've seen this is the one that pierces my fucking soul. I straight up just hugged my wife afterwords. Such a stupid accident and in one second lives were changed forever. 

Something about it hit harder than any torture video or anything like that. The fact that life is so delicate and fleeting, all it takes is a split second and you're reduced to a pile of meat, coupled with the terrible screams of agony as the person in the video realizes what happened...

I'm a fan of all Daft Punk's work, and my personal favorite album is Homework, but I will readily admit it's not for everyone, and some songs, while I love them, are frankly skippable when you aren't in ""the mood"" for them.

However, as soon as Discovery gets going, it doesn't let you leave ""the mood"" for the entire hour that it's on. Discovery is one long and perfect ballad, and is only better supplimented by the anime feature film Interstella 5555 produced alongside it by Leiji Matsumoto, creator of Captain Harlock.

RAM is good, check it out. Homework is good, check it out. Alive 2007? Please, it's like Daft Punk is jerking you off with fan service! How could you say no?

When Liam switched to using Reason for Invaders Must Die, suddenly he had the ability to produce at ten times the speed with ten times less hassle, and I really think that that freedom is what ruined his unique sound.

Comment,1,hdfy6cd,,0,1632042324.0,"So, this goes deep, but I'll try to give you a readers digest...

Kind of Blue introduced a series of harmonic and improvisational concepts that didn't previously exist (they did, but no well respected artist had codified it yet).

Essentially, jazz (which was mainstream popular music)  to this point largely centered on fast moving harmonic progressions: chord changes in quick succession, and navigating them fluidly was proof of high level musicianship. 

Kind of Blue utilizes what is now referred to as ""modal jazz"". ""Modes""are the various incarnations of chords and scales that exist within a major scale (there is more to this but we will stick with this definition for simplicity). Basically, what happened on Kind of Blue, is that the chord progression would sit on a single chord for a significantly longer amount of time, 8 to 16 to 32 bars instead of one. Sometimes more. 

This allowed for and forced the soloist to explore the harmonic possibilities of that single chord and create melodies, riffs, themes that pushed the music forward, instead of bouncing between chords every second and trying to build connectable ideas that are largely driven by the structure of the composition. 

Basically, the harmonic difference allowed high level improvisers (John Coltrane, Miles, cannonball adderly) to create complexity on the fly, instead of them working through and navigating the built in complexity.

It was a total conceptual shift. 

The impact? HIP HOP. Rap DOES NOT exist without this album. The riffing and textural elements of hip hop are directly rooted in Kind of Blue. Like...a direct lineage. Modern music does not exist without this album, period.",2021-09-19 12:05:24

Comment,1,hdfy5tg,,0,1632042313.0,"I was conducting a cell search and three cartel members ""trapped"" me inside the cell by blocking the entrance. One of them held an improvised knife (shiv) and the other two proceeded to try to interrogate me on what I was taking.

I took off my utility belt as a show that I wasn't going to back down from a fight, an in doing so slyly triggered the panic alarm on my radio while simultaneously making it look like I was shutting the radio off.

When the three saw that I was willing to fight to get out, they actually backed down and let me pass... of course by the moment, about 10+ officers were rushing to my location because I wasn't responding to my panic alarm.

Far as I know, they believed my reinforcements showed up because the bubble officer (camera watcher) called the emergency after not being able to contact me on my radio and never knew I had secretly summoned a small army to rescue me in the event of being jumped.

They even told me they thought it was ""pretty gutsy"" that I didn't back down while in the cell, and from that day onward I never had any problems with them or their group.",2021-09-19 12:05:13

The hanging part is only to create pain and suffering and to prolong the torture. The condemned are still alive for having their guts drawn from their body cavity and if the executioner is really lucky they will be barely alive for the quartering. I really hope people didn't live past being drawn but their must have been a few. Mexican cartel videos show you can skin a man alive and use a meth IV to keep them awake and alive. I don't know how even the cartels do that stuff. Nobody starts off being ok with doing that, you have to do a lot of fucked up stuff before you get to the point of some of these torture videos. It makes me sick people do that and I honestly wish I could go to the Canadian government.

A guy who can't figure out how to flirt with a girl. He sometimes gets to nervous to admit his true feelings to you. If he ever pauses, it is because he is thinking what he should say because he doesn't want it to come out the wrong way. he cares about your feelings alot and wants one girl to be his. If your that lucky girl, never lose him because he is worth a lot more than any guy out there.

Comment,1,hdfxu0o,,0,1632042053.0,"I used to live near a large open stormwater drain with no fencing around it. Three drunk guys drove their car straight into it. I went out and found the driver trying to get his friends foot out of the windshield. On the field on other side of the drain I saw the third passenger who was covered in blood. I asked if they were ok and my neighbour called the ambulance/police.

The blood covered friend passed out and was twitching so I ran to the car, grabbed a towel from the back seat and ran to help him. I found a large, deep cut on the back of his neck/head. I rolled him to his back and used the weight of his head to put pressure on the wound. I was talking to him, trying to keep him awake and he went into shock, twitching and unresponsive. 
This was the moment I thought an man died in my hands. I was able to wake him and the ambulance took over from there. That was the most harrowing moment of my life",2021-09-19 12:00:53

Comment,1,hdfxtgw,,0,1632042040.0,"Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.",2021-09-19 12:00:40

Somehow I think she still wants that date. 

Now I kinda want to slap myself. Do I take a vaccine for a girl? Do I? Do I take that risk? I might overthink it.

She has a dangerous level of positive influence on me.
